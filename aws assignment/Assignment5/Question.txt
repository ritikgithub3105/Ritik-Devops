Assignment 05  
(Implement Infrastructure with Terraform Module) 
-    Create Terraform Modules:  Organize your Terraform configuration into reusable modules. Modules should be created for key components such as VPCs, subnets, security groups, instances, etc. 
Good To Do: Terraform State Management & State Lock 
Use Amazon S3 to manage your Terraform state file. 
Enable state locking using DynamoDB to prevent concurrent modifications. 
Notes: 
Ensure that your S3 bucket and DynamoDB table are properly configured before running Terraform. 
Follow Terraform best practices for code organization and version control.
