Kafka Overview and One-Click Infrastructure Setup

1. Why Kafka?

Scalability: Kafka handles large-scale data with high throughput.
Reliability: Built for fault-tolerant distributed systems.
Real-Time: Supports real-time data processing and event streaming.
Use Cases: Log aggregation, stream processing, metrics collection, and messaging.

2. History

Developed at LinkedIn and open-sourced in 2011.
Became part of the Apache Software Foundation in 2012.

3. Centralized vs. Distributed Systems

Centralized Systems: Single point of failure, limited scalability.
Distributed Systems: High availability, fault tolerance, horizontal scaling.

4. Features

Distributed Architecture: Multiple brokers in a cluster.
Durability: Data replication for fault tolerance.
High Throughput: Processes millions of messages per second.
Scalable: Horizontal scaling with partitions.
Reliable: Persistent storage of messages.
Flexible: Supports pub-sub and point-to-point models.

5. Advantages

Decouples data producers and consumers.
Ensures high performance in real-time systems.
Provides strong durability and availability guarantees.

6. Publish and Subscribe Model

Producers: Publish messages to Kafka topics.
Consumers: Subscribe to topics and process messages.
Topics: Logical channels for data organization.

7. Architecture

Producers: Send data to Kafka brokers.
Brokers: Store and serve messages.
Topics and Partitions: Logical and physical data segmentation.
Consumers: Retrieve and process data.
ZooKeeper (or KRaft): Coordinates and manages the Kafka cluster.

8. Components

Broker: Handles storage and delivery of messages.
Topics: Organize and separate messages.
Producers/Consumers: Send/receive messages.
Partitions: Divide topics for parallelism.
ZooKeeper: Manages configurations and leader election.

9. One-Click Infrastructure Setup
Goal: Automate Kafka deployment using Terraform, AWS, and Ansible.

Practical: One-Click Infrastructure Setup

Using Jenkins for automate this tasks

Thanks this is my project for one click infra
